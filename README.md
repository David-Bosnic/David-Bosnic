### Hello, David here!
When I laid my fingers on a keyboard and wrote my first website, I felt the TCP protocol injected into my veins, and my love for coding was born. I am currently looking for a full-stack role to satisfy my hunger for creating nested `<div>`s
and to challenge myself not to make another wrapper for my API, ideally working with JavaScript or Lua but also willing to tackle some Go, would like to note Svelte is my posion but have worked with the classic React.I also have done some damage making videogames using the love2d framework, would not mind taking that physics minor and putting it to work. I would love to work for a startup; I find hitting the ground running and getting straight to the action with a really close team is the path I want to take. If you're hiring, feel free to send me a message!
## Highlights
