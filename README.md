# Hello, David here!
When I laid my fingers on a keyboard and wrote my first website, I felt the TCP protocol injected into my veins, and my love for coding was born. I am currently looking for a backend role to satisfy my hunger for creating things that just work, ideally working Go but will dabble in python; moreover, would like to note Svelte is my poison but have worked with the classic React for frontend work. I also have done some damage making video games using the love2d framework, would not mind taking that physics minor and putting it to work. I would love to work for a company that's focus on growth and able to quench my curiosity; I find hitting the ground running and getting straight to the action with a really close team is the path I want to take. If you're hiring, feel free to send me a message!
